            <h3 class="text-center">Facts: </h3>
            <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus,
                who, according
                to Greek mythology, was the grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the
                third-largest
                planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition
                to Neptune, and
                both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn.
                For this
                reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the other
                gas giants.
                Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and
                helium, but it
                contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons. It
                has the
                coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F),
                and has a
                complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the
                uppermost layer of
                clouds. The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.

                Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian
                system has a
                unique configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar
                orbit. Its
                north and south poles, therefore, lie where most other planets have their equators. In 1986, images from
                Voyager 2
                showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light, without the cloud bands or storms
                associated with the
                other giant planets. Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to visit the planet. Observations from Earth
                have
                shown seasonal change and increased weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in 2007. Wind
                speeds can reach 250
                metres per second (900 km/h; 560 mph).</p>

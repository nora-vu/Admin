        <p class="col">The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or
        indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the remainder
        being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly—the
        natural satellites—two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.</p>

        <p class="col">The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud.
        The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The
        four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock
        and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two
        largest planets, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost
        planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points
        compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have almost
        circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">Formation of the Solar System</h3>
        <img class="col" src="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/solar-system-formation/infographic.en.png" alt="formation">
        <p>The Solar System formed 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular
        cloud. This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars. As is typical
        of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements
        fused by previous generations of stars. As the region that would become the Solar System, known as the pre-solar
        nebula, collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster. The centre, where most of the mass
        collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. As the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began
        to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200 AU and a hot, dense protostar at the
        centre. The planets formed by accretion from this disc, in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each
        other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but
        they either merged or were destroyed, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor bodies.
        <br>
        Due to their higher boiling points, only metals and silicates could exist in solid form in the warm inner Solar System
        close to the Sun, and these would eventually form the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because metallic
        elements only comprised a very small fraction of the solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large.
        The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, the point between
        the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that
        formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets,
        allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant
        elements. Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt, Kuiper belt, and
        Oort cloud. The Nice model is an explanation for the creation of these regions and how the outer planets could have
        formed in different positions and migrated to their current orbits through various gravitational interactions.
        <br>
        Within 50 million years, the pressure and density of hydrogen in the centre of the protostar became great enough for it
        to begin thermonuclear fusion. The temperature, reaction rate, pressure, and density increased until hydrostatic
        equilibrium was achieved: the thermal pressure equalled the force of gravity. At this point, the Sun became a
        main-sequence star. The main-sequence phase, from beginning to end, will last about 10 billion years for the Sun
        compared to around two billion years for all other phases of the Sun's pre-remnant life combined. Solar wind from
        the Sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar
        space, ending the planetary formation process. The Sun is growing brighter; early in its main-sequence life its
        brightness was 70% that of what it is today.</p>
